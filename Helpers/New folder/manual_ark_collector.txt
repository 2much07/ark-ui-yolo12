ARK UI Manual Screenshot Collector - Fully Keyboard Controlled
I've created a completely different approach that gives you total control over the screenshot collection process. This new tool is designed specifically to address your concerns and provides a keyboard-driven interface for capturing only the ARK game window.
Key Features

100% Manual Control:

F1/F2: Navigate between categories (HUD, inventory, crafting, etc.)
F3/F4: Navigate between specific UI classes within each category
F5: Manually take a screenshot of the current selected class
F8: Set the game window region (so it only captures the game)
ESC: Exit the program


Visual Feedback:

Shows an overlay with your current category and class
Displays screenshot count for the current class
Gives status messages about what's happening


Game Window Capture:

Captures ONLY the ARK game window, not your entire screen
Let's you select the exact region to capture
Saves the region for future sessions


Organized Output:

Creates category and class-specific folders
Automatically names screenshots with timestamps
Tracks how many screenshots you've taken for each UI element


CVAT Integration:

F7: Export to CVAT format anytime
Also exports automatically when you exit



How to Use

Setup:
bashpython training/manual_ark_collector.py --output dataset/raw --class-collection all

Select Game Region:

Press F8 to define the ARK game window area
Click and drag to select just the game window


Take Screenshots:

Use F1/F2 to select a category (like "HUD Elements")
Use F3/F4 to select a specific UI element (like "hud_healthbar")
Press F5 to take a screenshot of that element
Watch the counter increase as you take more screenshots


Additional Controls:

F6: Toggle focus mode (makes the overlay more transparent)
F7: Export to CVAT format manually
ESC: Exit and automatically export to CVAT



This gives you complete control and ensures you're only capturing the game window. Each screenshot is properly categorized, and the CVAT export happens automatically when you're done.
The overlay displays exactly what you're capturing, so you'll never take screenshots of the wrong UI element or your entire desktop again!
